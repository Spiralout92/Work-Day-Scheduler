Purpose: The purpose of this website is an easy to use work day scheduler, that saves the events you type in according to the time slot boxes. The time slots start at 9AM and go to 5PM and you can see the current day, date, and year at the top under the title. As time progresses through the day, time slot colors update according to the current time. Past is in grey, present is in red, and future is green.

Current author: Maintenance and further contributions are made by Christopher Gonzalez.
